# Observation on Daily Visit and GA Session Data

## Overview
Two API responses represent different datasets with distinct data grains and schema complexity:

- **Data1:** Daily Visit data (`daily_visits`)
- **Data2:** GA Session data (`ga_sessions_20170801`)

---

## Data1 – Daily Visit
- **Grain:** Daily aggregate (one record per date)  
- **Structure:** Flat JSON  
- **Fields:**  
  - `visit_date` (DATE)  
  - `total_visits` (INTEGER)  
- **BigQuery Fit:**  
  - Simple to ingest as a single table  
  - Can be partitioned by `visit_date`  
  - Ideal for quick trend and volume analysis  

---

## Data2 – GA Session
- **Grain:** Session-level (one record per visit)  
- **Structure:** Deeply nested JSON with arrays and structs  
- **Nested Fields:**  
  - `device`, `geoNetwork`, `totals`, `trafficSource` (STRUCT)  
  - `customDimensions`, `hits_sample` (ARRAY<STRUCT>)  
- **BigQuery Fit:**  
  - Requires nested field support or flattening into multiple tables  
  - Suitable for detailed behavior and attribution analysis  
  - Larger, more complex schema

## Key Differences for BigQuery

| Aspect | Daily Visit  | GA Session |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Data Grain | Daily summary | Session detail |
| Schema | Flat | Nested |
| Ease of Load | Easy | Complex |
| Partitioning | By date | By date |
| Use Case | Trend reports | Deep user/session analysis |

---

**Summary:**  
Daily Visit is lightweight and ready for direct BigQuery ingestion, while GA Session provides richer, session-level insights that require handling nested structures or multi-table modeling.
